/**
 * @brief     
 * @details   There are two Auxiliary registers which control all three devices. One is the 
 *            interrupt status register, the second is the Auxiliary enable register. The Auxiliary 
 *            IRQ status register can help to hierarchically determine the source of an interrupt.
 * 
 *            If the enable bits are clear you will have no access to a peripheral. You can not even 
 *            read or write the registers!
 * 
 *            GPIO pins should be set up first the before enabling the UART. The UART core is build 
 *            to emulate 16550 behaviour. So when it is enabled any data at the inputs will 
 *            immediately be received . If the UART1_RX line is low (because the GPIO pins have not 
 *            been set-up yet) that will be seen as a start bit and the UART will start receiving 
 *            0x00-characters. 
 *
 *            Valid stops bits are not required for the UART. (See also Implementation details). 
 *            Hence any bit status is acceptable as stop bit and is only used so there is clean 
 *            timing start for the next bit. 
 *
 *            Looking after a reset: the baudrate will be zero and the system clock will be 250 MHz. 
 *            So only 2.5 Âµseconds suffice to fill the receive FIFO. The result will be that the 
 *            FIFO is full and overflowing in no time flat.
